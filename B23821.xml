            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Whereas the Proof of this Matter must be made good by the Computation of the Number of Persons that do wear <hi>Hatts</hi> of one Price or other.</p>
            <p>The Proposer takes it for Granted that it will be Allowed that there are three Millions of Males at least in this Kingdom, when according to Sir <hi>William Pettys</hi> Calculation and others, there are about Eight Millions of Males and Females; and the former much the Majority, besides Strangers and floating People.</p>
            <p>Then if it be agreed that there are three Millions of Males, besides the many Females that wear <hi>Hatts,</hi> and that upon an Average it cannot be reduced to less than 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per Head,</hi> taking the higher Prices with the lower: According to that Number it amounts to the Summe of Two Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Considering the Duty is laid so Easie, (every Man Charging himself by the Price of his <hi>Hatt</hi> what he pleaseth,) if it should be thought fit to advance the Rates above-mentioned, the produce would rise by Equal Proportion without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Injury.</p>
            <p>In all other Taxes those that have Families have born the greatest part when the least able; By this it Appears that a single Person shall pay equal.</p>
            <p>Besides there's no one Commodity that is more Universal, or that the People love to have in a better Decorum than a <hi>Hatt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although it be computed that the Medium Price according to the Rates set down will be One Shilling and Six Pence <hi>per Head;</hi> (which amounts to the Summe before-mentioned) yet the Change of Fashions will greatly Augment the Revenue.</p>
            <p>The Collecting of this Duty will be Easie and Practicable, and not attended with a Numerous Train of Officers; For not only the greatest Number of <hi>Hatts,</hi> but <hi>Hatts</hi> of the greatest Value are made in and about <hi>London</hi> to serve the Nation in General, and Consequently three parts in four of this Duty will be Collected in this City.</p>
            <p>The Certainty of having this Duty paid, will be by laying a Penalty upon every Maker or Retailer of <hi>Hatts</hi> that shall vend or expose to Sale any sort of <hi>Hatts</hi> without having first received a Seal or Impression from the Office Appointed for that purpose, according to the value of the said <hi>Hatts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Seal or Impression to appear visible in the Middle of the Crown within the <hi>Hatt, without any Dis-Ornament,</hi> being the place where all Eminent <hi>Haberdashers</hi> fix their Own Seals, to be known by.</p>
            <p>Neither can there be any manner of Encouragement to Counterfeit the said Seal or Impression, being so Trivial and so subject to a Discovery.</p>
            <p>And although all <hi>Hatts</hi> be obliged to receive such Seal or Impression to prevent any Fraud, yet that it may not be a discouragement to the Exportation of that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, Every such Person as shall Export the same, upon Certificate from the <hi>Custom-House</hi> shall receive the Draw-back at the Office where first paid.</p>
